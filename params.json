  "body": "### Welcome to my CM124 Final Project\r\nThis project is designed to assemble complete haplotypes from a series of incomplete reads. Humans have two haplotypes, one from each parent. Unfortunately for us, sequencing reads done by machine only contain information regarding one of these haplotypes. Information on both haplotypes is contained within this sequencing read, however. So, by tiling together reads (using a greedy algorithm written in Python) we can reassemble complete haplotypes.\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nMy name is Scott de Taboada and I'm a third year undergraduate student at UCLA studying computational mathematics. As an undergraduate who's fairly new to computer science I decided to take on an easy version of project 2, haplotype assembly. This is one of my first times programming in Python and I look forward to keeping you up to do date with my progress until the completion of this project.\r\n\r\n### Goals\r\n- Come up with an algorithm to go through reads and place them in the haplotype they match\r\n- Write a function to generate data\r\n- Write a function to read this data into strings my algorithm can work with\r\n- Assemble complete haplotypes assuming no errors\r\n\r\n### Code\r\n- [Project code](https://github.com/scottdet/scottdet.github.io)\r\n- Presentation \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
