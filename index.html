<p>My name is Scott de Taboada and I'm a third year student at UCLA studying computational mathematics. As an undergraduate who's fairly new to computer science I decided to take on an easy version of project 2, haplotype assembly. This is one of my first times programming in Python and I look forward to keeping you up to date with my progress until the completion of this project.</p>

<p>This project is designed to assemble complete haplotypes from a series of incomplete reads. Humans have two haplotypes, one from each parent. Unfortunately for us, sequencing reads done by machine only contain information regarding one of these haplotypes. However, information on both haplotypes is contained within this sequencing read and so by tiling together reads (using a greedy algorithm written in Python) we can reassemble complete haplotypes.</p>

<h3>
<a id="goals" class="anchor" href="#goals" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Come up with an algorithm to go through reads and place them in the haplotype they match</li>
<li>Write a function to generate data</li>
<li>Write a function to read this data into strings my algorithm can work with</li>
<li>Assemble complete haplotypes assuming no errors</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Week 7:

<ul>
<li>Attempting to write my assembly algorithm</li>
<li>This is proving difficult I don't really know what I'm doing in Python, will report back when I have some idea.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<ul>
<li>Week 8:

<ul>
<li>Switching to C++, maybe this will make things easier as I have a much better knowledge of the language.</li>
<li>It's only the middle of week 7 and I already see this^ was a bad idea. Going back to Python, guess I need to learn anyway!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<ul>
<li>Week 9:

<ul>
<li>Figured out how to read and generate data.</li>
<li>Not sure how to import given data, will save for a time when said given data has been sent out.</li>
<li>Still running into issues with my algorithm. Isn't working the way it should and haplotypes don't turn out correctly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<ul>
<li>Week 10:

<ul>
<li>Finally got things up and running.</li>
<li>not sure I'll be able to do much more in terms of other levels of difficulty as it took me this long to complete "easy."</li>
<li>When allowing for errors things get much more difficult. Also need to test my algorithm for accuracy not just speed now.</li>
<li>All done for now, pretty happy with my progress. At least the final exam wasn't too difficult!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<ul>
<li>Moving Forward:

<ul>
<li>I hope to continue working on this project in an attempt to at the very least complete the "medium" difficulty.</li>
<li>Feel free to check back in a few weeks from now to see my progress!</li>
</ul>
